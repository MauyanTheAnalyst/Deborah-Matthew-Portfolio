## Data Overview

* Public Fitbit fitness tracker dataset
* Includes daily activity, steps, calories, sleep, heart rate, and weight data
* Data was cleaned, validated, and analyzed before visualization

> *Note: Dataset is publicly available and used strictly for educational purposes.*

---

## Analytical Approach

1. **Excel**

   * Cleaned and validated raw datasets
   * Standardized date formats and removed inconsistencies

2. **SQL**

   * Created views to summarize activity, sleep, intensity, and user behavior
   * Segmented users into activity categories (sedentary → very active)
   * Analyzed trends by weekday and hour

3. **Power BI**

   * Built an interactive dashboard to visualize:

     * Activity levels
     * Sleep patterns
     * Peak engagement periods
     * User segmentation

---

## Key Insights

* Most users are **moderately or lightly active**
* Activity peaks occur in the **early morning and evening**
* A significant number of users fall into **sedentary or lightly active** categories
* Consistent daily activity correlates more with engagement than occasional intense workouts

---

## Business Recommendations

* Promote **balanced wellness messaging** focused on consistency
* Send **time-based notifications** during peak activity periods
* Design **beginner-friendly challenges** for lightly active users
* Use user segmentation to drive **personalized marketing campaigns**
