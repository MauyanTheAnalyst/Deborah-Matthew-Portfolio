## Data Overview

* Public Fitbit fitness tracker dataset
* Includes daily activity, steps, calories, and sleep metrics
* Data covers multiple users over a defined time period
* Dataset was cleaned, validated, and structured before analysis

> *Note: This dataset is publicly available and used strictly for educational purposes.*

---

## Analytical Approach

The analysis followed an end-to-end data workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning (Excel)**

   * Removed duplicates and inconsistencies
   * Standardized date and time formats
   * Verified missing and invalid values

2. **Data Analysis (SQL)**

   * Analyzed daily activity levels and step patterns
   * Identified active vs lightly active users
   * Explored time-based usage trends
   * Aggregated metrics for meaningful comparisons

3. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**

   * Built an interactive dashboard showing:

     * Daily activity trends
     * User engagement levels
     * Calories burned vs activity intensity
     * Peak usage periods

---

## Key Insights

* Most users were **moderately active**, with activity peaking in the **early morning and evening**
* A significant portion of users fell into **lightly active or fairly categories**
* Higher activity levels were strongly associated with increased calorie burn
* Consistent daily engagement appeared more impactful than sporadic intense activity

---

## Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were proposed for Bellabeat:

* **Promote balanced wellness messaging** that encourages consistency rather than intensity
* **Leverage time-based notifications** during peak activity periods (morning and evening)
* **Target lightly active users** with beginner-friendly challenges and achievable goals
* Use insights to guide **personalized marketing campaigns** and in-app engagement strategies
